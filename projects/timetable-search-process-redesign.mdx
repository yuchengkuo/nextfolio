## Overview

This self-implemented project is to practice experience and interface design skills. The idea came from personal struggle with the current product. The goal was to redesign a more intuitive and simplified process for timetable searching.

## Discovery

### Background

[Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA)](https://www.railway.gov.tw/tra-tip-web/tip?lang=EN_US) manages and maintains the railway service in Taiwan. Recently released (2019) fourth generation of the ticket booking system offers services like ticket booking, timetable searching, and live train info. Thereâ€™re other third party apps that provide similar services, but ticket booking is exclusive to the official TRA platform.

The project covers the redesign of the mainly used service, search process for train timetable.

### The Problem

One of the problems in the current searching process is it's tedious and time-consuming. Especially when the user need to switch between the departure and arrival stations often, or switch between different type of results. **Users will need to take multiple similar actions to obtain the search results.**

ðŸ‘‰Note: From the user feedback on the [app store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1441617748) and [google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tw.gov.tra.twtraffic), the payment process also have some problems, as well as other miscellaneous improvements.

### The Challenge

- Large amount of the stations and counties: 242 stations and 19 counties.
- 3 different result types: timetable, station, and train.
- 7 sublines apart from the mainline.

### Current Analysis

For official TRA-E booking app, I throughly analyzed the current product and service flow, hoping to discover the opportunities to improve the overall experience.

ðŸ‘‰Note: Other third-party apps also share similar search process so I focus on the official one.

### Map Out Current User Flow

The current user flow breaks the process into 4 different flows but similar elements appears in each one, common actions are like selecting stations, set date & time, train type, etc.

### Assumptions

1. Most of the users go for timetable search.
2. Users tend to not manually input the information (e.g. stations, date and time...).

## Define

<!--
To better define the goal, I assumed a use case to demonstrate. In this use case we have a hypothetical user
He wants to search for two timetable for
search the timetable from Kaohsiung to Taipei
and Taichung to Hualien
and look up for the train stops

### Design Goal

To represent the search goals, let's assign a task. The task is to search for train timetable from Taipei station to Kaohsiung, and find the

The focus will be on the search process, the main goal is to reduced search time by 40%.
let's assume the user want to search for the train timetable for tomorrow, from Taipei to Kaohsiung.
original process approximately took \_\_\_ min to accompolish -->

### Ideation

With the problems and analysis, I sketch out some ideas to visulaize possible solutions. **Avoiding the usage of long list is my top consideration.**

### User Flow

### Detailed User Flow

The main user flow is assumed to be searching for timetable, and without manually inputting the stations or trains.

## Design

With how it will work in mind and after some explorations, I find this version the most clear and simple.

## Develop

### Mid-fidelity Interactive Prototype

I created a interactive prototype to demonstrates the redesigned search process flow and some of the interaction.

## Outcome

<!-- ### Test & Validation

For the redesigned search process, the approximate time-needed is -->

### Reflection

The project taught me the design process and what should be considered at each phase. And here are some things that I might do differently.

1. Icons for train type app.
2. Color coding for main stations.
3. Swipe actions.

### Next Step

Some further implementations could be done,

1. Hi-fi prototype.
2. Using the real data.
