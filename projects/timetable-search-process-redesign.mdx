## Overview

This project is a self-implemented practice for better experience and interface design skills, and the idea comes from personal struggle with the current product. The main goal was to redesign a more intuitive and fluent process for timetable search.

## Discovery

### Background

Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) is the train transportation in Taiwan.

Recently released (2019) fourth generation of the ticket booking system offers common services like ticket booking, timetable searching, and live train info. Thereâ€™re other third party apps provide similar

This project covers the redesign of the mainly used service, search process for timetable.

### The problems

The main problem of the current search process is tedious and time-consuming, especially when the user need to switch between the departure and arrival stations often.

### The challenges

- Large amount of the stations and counties (242 stations & 19 counties)
- 3 ways to show the results
- Subline / mainline (7 sublines)

### Current analysis

For [official TRA app](linkToApp), I throughly analyzed the current product and experience, hoping to discover the opportunities to improve the experience.

Other apps for train timetable also have similar search process.
