## Overview

This project is a self-implemented practice for better experience and interface design skills, and the idea comes from personal struggle with the current product. The main goal was to redesign a more intuitive and fluent process for timetable search.

## Discovery

### Background

Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) is the train transportation in Taiwan.

Recently released (2019) fourth generation of the ticket booking system offers common services like ticket booking, timetable searching, and live train info. Thereâ€™re other third party apps provide similar

This project covers the redesign of the mainly used service, search process for timetable.

### The problems

The main problem of the current search process is tedious and time-consuming, especially when the user need to switch between the departure and arrival stations often.

### The challenges

- Large amount of the stations and counties. (242 stations & 19 counties)
- The results contains 3 different show types.
- 7 sublines apart from mainline.

### Current analysis

For [official TRA app](linkToApp), I throughly analyzed the current product and experience, hoping to discover the opportunities to improve the experience.

Other apps for train timetable also have similar search process.

## Define

### Design Goal

The focus will be on the search process, the main goal is to reduced search time by 40%.

### Ideation

With the problems and analysis, I sketch out some ideas to visulaize possible solutions, especially avoiding the usage of long list is my top consideration.

### User Flow

The user flow shows how the users will interact with the product and help me identify what user could encounter during the search process.

### Wireframe

I did lots of explorations in wireframes to show how the structure and break the whole interface into components for better reusability.

### Wireflow

Combine the usr flowchart ang the wireframe to get more sense of how the search process will look and how it will work.

## Design

With how it will work in mind, I moved on to the visual design, after some attempt and exploration I find this version the most clear and simple.

### Search Tab

The search tab consists of current departure and arrival stations, date and time, train type and recent search history.
