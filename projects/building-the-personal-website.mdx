## Overview

This project is a periodic wrap-up for my learning in interface design and web development. A project done solo, designed in Figma, coded in VS Code, and deployed with Vercel, hoping to better understand the workflow and current technology.

## Research

### My Beginning of Learning Web

I started learning about web tech back in 2016, **originally I was interested in how to build a more interactive presentation to better involve the listeners.** And that came from the findings of lacking attention from the listeners in courses or speeches. My attempt to address the problem was to think about, the presentation can be more interactive if...

- The presenter is experienced.
- The presentation is visually attractive.
- Use a more flexible presentation tool.

My attention was more on the last two, to use graphics and motion so that the listeners can be more involved. (But it's still mostly about the presenter and the context though.)

Besides, since the files are generally made offline, it requires copy & paste and has other drawbacks too. ‚ÄúWhat if the files can be accessed with a simple url?‚Äù **So I started digging presentation tools and thought about what presentation could be, which lead me into learning web tech.**

The search for presentation tools got me into learning web. It's not a typical start but glad that I let my curiosity lead the way. Pulled from my dim memories, I learned HTML and CSS on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and gradually understood what elements make up interfaces that we see on the browsers. And also tried building something simple with what I had learned.

### The Questions

As I progressed, there were two wonders on my mind,

1. **‚ÄúHow these interfaces are actually built?‚Äù**
2. **‚ÄúIs it possible to do it in a visual way?‚Äù**

The first one was more about the **reusability and the maintainability**. Because I didn't think doing it all manually is a good and efficient idea. The second one came up during my practice, I wondered if it could be done visually with the box model concept and the tag structure.

These two questions were there for some time. Later I learned that it involved back-end technology (like PHP) to make the website dynamic. (And that's probably my understanding.) Regarding the visual way to build websites, there're some tools with this feature. The one that interested me the most was [Webflow](https://webflow.com/). The flexibility and concept behind it are so cool to me.

And the journey of learning web came to a pause after I started the [formula student project](/#project). **Looking back, what I learned was more about front-end and the design side, and I think they became preliminary foundation of this website.üèó**

### Inspirations

Before getting into the next phase, I spent some time browsing through websites looking for inspirations, and also collecting trends and tech being used in modern websites. There were lots of ‚Äúwow, so cool!‚Äù moments during this time.üò≤

## Define

### Purposes of the Site

- Build online presence
- Learning & sharing
- Showcasing work

### Ideation

## Design

### Grid System

Two sizes are used, 960 pixels and 640 pixels. 640px is used in text wrapper since I find it much easier to read.

## Develop

### Relearn Development

Originally the plan was building the website using [Webflow](https://webflow.com/). The main advantage with Webflow is you can quickly build it up without worrying about too much anything. (Plus [Webflow University](https://university.webflow.com/) has many great resources).

I decided to relearn web development on the side for a couple of reasons. The first centainly is curiosity, it's always fulfilling to know how it works. Second, it could become one of my skills. And also it helps me focus more, since I can change over different topics staggeringly, avoiding the fatigue from doing same thing for too long.

With prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, I picked up the progress and relearn JS, which is another big chapter to consume. I find learning and practicing concurrently is the most efficient way to grow. And with the learning of JS, it lead me to framework [React](https://reactjs.org/), that makes building UI elements easier and more managable.

### Discover React

I really like the component-based concept of React, it makes much sense to me with the questions mentioned earlier. It took me many times reading the docs and practicing to get clearer understanding. But there is still a long way to go!

At the same time I learned about [site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/) and Jamstack, a modern architecture that brings benifits to modern websites. I learned about it from website built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and finally landed on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

### Centent Generation

Writing all the content here is another challenge. It takes more than a good documentation, and also how to organize the work and put it into words. But just like everything else, learning, practicing, and iterate...

## Deliver

### Deploy

The source is hosted on Github and the website is deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com). The source can be found [here](https://github.com/yuchengkuo/nextfolio).

## Lessons Learned

### Constantly Learning

Learning is a continuous process. And curiosity is the key.üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Design & Development

I learned the relation between design and development, and how collaboration and conversation will play such a major role in a team.

### Researching

There're tons of resources on the internet, properly make use of them for tools, knowledges, or data needed could help a lot.

## Next Step

The whole journey of learning and building is challenging but fun (mostly). And there're still a lot of things to try and play around. Keep moving forward and making progress!

### Reflection

Few things that I think could be improved,

1. Testing of the site
2. Documentation: Keep track of the everything related is a habit to stay oragnized and it will be easier to collect when needed.
3. Start Practicing: Start practicing sooner and learn from the practice is more important than learning without practice.
