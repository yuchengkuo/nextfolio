## Overview

> This is a project about discovery, teamwork, and passion.🔥

As new technology evolves much more quickly, the rapid advancement of industry makes it harder for undergrad students to keep up. Therefore, we were hoping through this project we can closer the gap and also discover new possibilities.

This project started at my junior year at NCKU, with less than 10 members to begin(30 when season ended). **The primary goal was to build a formula-style racecar to compete in Formula Student (FS) event.** As one of the kick-off members, I had the opportunity to execute and learn end to end. It was a wild ride and special experience for me.🤘🏼

### The Competition

Formula Student (or [Formula SAE](https://www.fsaeonline.com/) in some countries) is one of the biggest student events around the world, **whose purpose is giving undergrad students an opportunity for practical application skills**.

The teams shall think themselves as a small-scale vehicle manufacturer to design, develop and produce a formula-style racecar, working on various aspects like operating, designing, manufacturing and marketing. **As for now, more than 20 events and 200 teams are active around the world**.

There are two events in the competition, static event and dynamic event. Static event is about rule-compliance, safety, strategy, and business presentation, dynamic is about the performance on track. **Teams have to pass the static technical inspection to join dynamic event.**

> We participated in Formula Student Japan 2019, which was held at late Aug.

### Competition Type

**There are three main classes in the competition, combustion, electric and autonomous.** Combustion started at 1980s, which has the longest history and most resources, therefore it’s easiest to begin and has largest amount of teams. Electric was introduced in 2010s, with the increase of difficulty, resources taken and issue of safety, while the project aspects are wider than combustion gasoline. Autonomous started at 2019, which is the most advanced, now teams and competitions are mostly in Europe and US.

> We aimed for electric class for broader diversity and promising trend of EV.⚡️

## Research

This project took 12 months to build out the vehicle, and the overall timeline was research, design, develop, test and finally participate in the race, which consisted of different iterations and timeline for each subteam.

We started with getting familiar with the competition and did some research about how an entry-year team should be aiming in the first attempt. From reading the [competition rules](https://www.fsaeonline.com/cdsweb/gen/DocumentResources.aspx), learning from documentations, and looking for advice from experienced teams, **the idea was to build up the necessary knowledge as soon as possible.**

### Key Findings

We learned that most of the team spent 1+ years for their first attempt, so setting an appropriate goal would be crucial for us. And **FS is usually viewed as a degree-level project, sometimes considered a standard by automobile industry for engineering students to transition from university to workspace.** As a student-centric event, safety is undoubtly the first concern, therefore strictness of the inspection could be imagined, that is, it won’t be easy for first-year university and students.

### Project Goal

Realizing the project scope and the competition, our goal was to f

> Desgin and develop the first electric racecar to finish the race. (At least pass the static inspection.)

### The Challenge

- Where does the resources (financial and material) come from?
- How much resources do we need?
- How to find members we need / team building?

> Reach out & Look for help

**We first pitched this idea to the experienced and alumus**, looking for advice and potential assistances. Thankfully we received many encouragement and valuable advice, which became a huge boost for us.

And we recruited more members first from acquaintances, and then built more presence through some campaigns(club festival etc) to reach out to those with different background. It’s a challenge when we had nothing but a passionate heart🔥.

**Finally we spent time visiting other experienced team**, [NTHU Racing](https://www.facebook.com/NTHU.Racing), [STUST Racing](https://www.facebook.com/ST.RacingTeam2005), and [Taipei Tech Racing](https://www.facebook.com/TaipeiTechRacing). Actually seeing what they've built and listening to their stories really taught us a lot (and realized it's going to be tough.🤞🏼)

On the other hand, often time we found ourselves lost in sudden amout of information🤯, filtering and transforming them into future plans were what we managed to learn.

## Design

> This section will focus on frame design.

I started the design process by reading other teams’ design documentations, and take their final result as reference and inspiration. These were the questions I tried to answer then,

- Why do them design this way?
- What’s good and potential improvements?
- How's the results?

Listing these questions out helped me understand the process and prioritize top considerations for our case. Then I started do some sketches to familiarize the frame structure and ideate possible applications. After that I began modeling using software (SolidWorks), revisited the process, made adjustments, then started over again. **Few times of iterations quickly got me on track and moved on to the bigger iteration with different subteams.** Discussing, modifying and iterating became routine until the end of the design phase (technically it’s end of the season).

### Design Goals

With all the research findings, advices obtained and ideas come-up, the goals were set,

1. Simplicity
2. Compact space usage
3. Easy modification (in software)

### The Challenges

- How to keep the design up-to-date?
- Design versioning management?
- Collaboration with other subteam?

> Discuss & Understand

For me, **designing frame is more like figuring out a way to integrate all components onto vehicle with different subteams.** Therefore it’s essential to know the basic of the components on the vehicle.

Frequent discussions kept everyone on the same page, and when there’s change or idea, it could be quickly implemented. Furthermore, it’s a must to understand why the modifications were needed and different subteams’ goals and constraints, almost always theirs were also one for frame in some way. Discuss the solutions, understand the needs.

## Develop

(After countless design changes we finally made it to the development!🛠)

The development process wasn’t at sync for every subteams and components on the vehicle, thus cooperation across the team was especially important. **For frame, the major tasks were material (steel tubes and sheet metal), pre-development preparation (tube end for welding, sheet metal bending), development (welding), and validation.** For most of the development process, lacking practical experience was a problem, apart from picking up the skills beforehand, collaboration with the industry was another strategy.

### Collaborate with the industry

Reaching out to local corporations let us know practical applications being used right now. And we also learned that been designed and ready to develop are two things, there are many prerequisites like drawing, material, timeline confirmation before getting into development. **Working with the industry taught us more about professional workflow, and also started to understand the industry standards.** Really appreciate the assistance and advice every company gave!

/>

### The Challenges

- How to solve problems that came up during development?
- How to collaborate between different subteams?
- Timeline delay & collision?

> Identify & Evaluate

For problems appeared in development, eg, found out that a component didn’t fit, or didn’t comply to the rule,

normally we identified what’s the impact, and discussed a way to solve in the least influence. Development was another battle after the design phase,

Well communication across the team played an important part in timeline arrangement, the key was having everyone in the situation so the development could keep moving forward. Besides, having a plan B is essential to make sure the process could continue with a backup even in the worst situation.

## Test

The testing was not only for validation of our designs, but also for driver to get acquainted with the vehicle (even though we barely had time left). **We also ran through the competition items to make sure everything was ready and to let us know what to do when similar situations occur.**

### The Challenges

- Looking for the testing site.
- Procedure when problems occur.
- Transportation to competition site.

**At this time the problems usually showed up suddenly, we must learn to react quickly and address accordingly.** What we could do was trying to lower the chance and building a procedure to handle similar problems. And before getting into the competition, teams have to submit a video of vehicle in operation, (Shakedown Certificate), in a way to make sure teams are ready for competition.

## Compete

Before getting into the competition, the shipment from Taiwan to Japan took approximate 3 weeks, we focused on presentation and design documentation then.

### On-site

**For FS Japan 2019, there were 98 teams, with 27 electric vehicles participating and 4 teams from Taiwan.** The competition was 5 days long, 3 for static event and 2 for dynamic event. As mentioned, the team has to pass the static inspection to compete in the dynamic event for safety concern. And for electric class, teams have to pass both technical and electrical inspection to be qualified in dynamic.

The static event wasn’t that smooth for us but we took it one step at a time. The challenge was the competition wasn’t long, teams had to ran through all the events quickly, especially inspection. The most important things to consider was rule-compliance, safety, and communication between judges. Unfortunately, we miss the deadline for the static event since we stuck in final check for electric system, we couldn’t join dynamic event.

    },
  ]}
/>

For the last 2 days, apart from enjoying the dynamic event🏎️, we also spent lots of time learning from the judges and other teams. It was brilliant to find so many passionate hearts and be able to share experiences and thoughts with each other. And we were so glad that some designs were recognized for a first year electric team after cash with some judges. The competition clearly showed us what could be achieved with the effort from both industry and academic.

Note: For 27 EVs, 11 passed the inspection, 9 joined the dynamic event, 7 finished the race, e ended up 13 out of 27. More information about the completion results can be found [here](https://www.jsae.or.jp/formula/en/docu/2019announcements.pdf).

## Lesson Learned

### Self-education

The knowledge and tool were mostly new (or unfamiliar) to us, thus learning by ourselves became basic skill we must have. It can be said that **learning is one of the core reasons this project exists.**

### Cross-division collaboration

It’s impossible to have these great achievements without teamwork, collaboration between members with different backgrounds is essential behind these results.

### Problems solving techniques

The whole journey in this project was full of problems, not only technical but also team operational and many other aspects. This is the one I feel the most after the season ended.
