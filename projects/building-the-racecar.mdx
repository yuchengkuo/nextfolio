## Overview

> This is a project about discovery, teamwork, and passion.

As new technology evolves much more quickly, the rapid advancement of the industry makes it harder for undergrad students to keep up. Therefore, we were hoping through this project we can closer the gap and also discover new possibilities.

This project started during my junior year at NCKU, with less than 10 members to begin (30 when the season ended). **The primary goal was to build a formula-style racecar to compete in Formula Student (FS) event.** As one of the kick-off members, I had the opportunity to execute and learn end to end. It was a wild ride and a special experience for me.🤘🏼

### The Competition

Formula Student (or [Formula SAE](https://www.fsaeonline.com/) in some countries) is one of the biggest student events around the world, **whose purpose is giving undergrad students an opportunity for practical application skills**.

The teams shall think themselves as small-scale vehicle manufacturers to design, develop and produce a formula-style racecar, working on various aspects like operating, designing, manufacturing and marketing. **As for now, more than 20 events and 200 teams are active around the world**.

There are two events in the competition, static event and dynamic event. Static event is about rule-compliance, safety, strategy, and business presentation, dynamic is about the performance on the track. **Teams have to pass the static technical inspection to join the dynamic event.**

> We participated in [Formula Student Japan 2019](https://www.jsae.or.jp/formula/en/17th/eventoutline.php), which was held at late Aug.

### Competition Type

**There are three main classes in the competition, combustion, electric and autonomous.** Combustion started in the 1980s, which has the longest history and most resources, therefore it’s easiest to begin and has the largest amount of teams. Electric was introduced in the 2010s, with the increase of difficulty, resources-taken, and the issue of safety, while the project aspects are wider than combustion gasoline. Autonomous started in 2019, which is the most advanced, now teams and competitions are mostly in Europe and the US.

> We aimed for electric class for broader diversity and promising trend of EV.⚡️

### The Process

This project took 12 months to build out the vehicle, and the overall timeline was research, design, develop, test and finally participate in the race. Each subteams then had their own iterations and plans in accordance to the main timeline.

## Research

We started with getting familiar with the competition and did some research about how an entry-year team should be aiming in the first attempt. From reading the [competition rules](https://www.fsaeonline.com/cdsweb/gen/DocumentResources.aspx), learning from documentations, and looking for advice from experienced teams, **the idea was to build up the necessary knowledge as soon as possible.**

### Key Findings

We learned that most of the team spent 1+ years for their first attempt, so setting an appropriate goal would be crucial for us. And **FS is usually viewed as a degree-level project, sometimes considered a standard by the automobile industry for engineering students to transition from university to workspace.** As a student-centric event, safety is undoubtedly the first concern, therefore strictness of the inspection could be imagined and it won’t be easy for first-year university and students.

### Project Goal

Realizing the project scope and the competition, our goal focused on finishing the race. Thus we can obtain most experience from the event for improvements and strategies in the future. In the worst case senario, we aimed to pass the static inspection so that the vehicle will be rule-compliant.

### The Challenge

- Where do the resources (financial and material) come from?
- How many resources do we need?
- How to find members we need / team building?

> Reach out & Look for help

We first pitched this idea to the experienced and alumnus, looking for advice and potential assistance. Thankfully we received much encouragement and valuable advice, which became a huge boost for us.🚀

And we recruited more members first from acquaintances, and then built more presence through some school campaigns (like club festival and etc) to reach out to those with different backgrounds. It’s a challenge when we had nothing but a passionate heart.🔥

Finally we spent time visiting other experienced team, [NTHU Racing](https://www.facebook.com/NTHU.Racing), [STUST Racing](https://www.facebook.com/ST.RacingTeam2005), and [Taipei Tech Racing](https://www.facebook.com/TaipeiTechRacing). Seeing what they've built and listened to their stories taught us a lot (and realized it's going to be tough.🤞🏼)

On the other hand, often time we found ourselves lost in a sudden amount of information🤯, filtering and transforming them into plans were what we managed to learn.

## Design

> This section will focus on frame design.

I started the design process by reading other teams’ design documentations, and take their result as references and inspiration. These were the questions I tried to answer then,

- Why do they design this way?
- What are good and potential improvements?
- How are the results?

Listing these questions out helped me understand the process and prioritize top considerations for our case. Then I started to do some sketches to familiarize the frame structure and ideate possible applications. After that, I began modeling using software (SolidWorks), revisited the process, made adjustments, then started over again.🔄 **Few times of iterations quickly got me on track and moved on to the bigger iteration with different subteams.** Discussing, modifying, and iterating became routine until the end of the design phase (technically it’s the end of the season😅).

### Design Goals

With all the research findings, advice obtained and ideas come-up, the goals were set to be,

1. Simplicity
2. Compact space usage
3. Easy modification (in software)

### The Challenges

- How to keep the design up-to-date?
- Design versioning management?
- Collaboration with other subteams?

> Discuss & Understand

For me, **designing a frame is more like figuring out a way to integrate all components onto the vehicle with different subteams.** Therefore it’s essential to know the basics of the components on the vehicle.

Frequent discussions kept everyone on the same page, and when there’s a change or idea, it could be quickly implemented. It was more important for a rookie team like us to quickly iterate different approach to find a suitable one for the project goal.

Furthermore, it’s a must to understand why the modifications were needed, and be aware of other subteams’ goals and constraints. Almost always they connected back to frame in some way. So for me, it's discuss the implementaions, and understand the needs.

## Develop

(After countless design changes we finally made it to the development!🛠)

The development process wasn’t in sync for every subteam and component on the vehicle, thus cooperation across the team was especially important. **For frame, the major tasks were material (steel tubes and sheet metal), pre-development preparation (tube end for welding, sheet metal bending), development (welding), and validation.** For most of the development process, lacking practical experience was a problem, apart from picking up the skills beforehand, collaboration with the industry was another strategy.

### Collaborate with the industry

Reaching out to local corporations let us know practical applications being used right now. And we also learned that been designed and ready to develop are two things, there are many prerequisites like drawing, material, timeline confirmation before getting into development. **Working with the industry taught us more about professional workflow, and also started to understand the industry standards.** Really appreciate the assistance and advice every company gave!

### The Challenges

- How to solve problems that came up during development?
- How to collaborate between different subteams?
- Timeline delay & collision?

> Identify & Evaluate

Problmes that showed up in the development process were next challenges in this project. They could be design errors, against the rules, or just something we never thought of. Normally we would identify the impact and tried to solve it using the least one. But it's easier said than done, we just tried our best to sort it with the best possible way.💭

Good communication across the team played an important part in timeline arrangement. Have the development process keep moving forward was the goal. Besides, having a plan B is essential to make sure the process could continue with a backup even in the worst situation.

## Test

The testing was not only for validation of our designs but also for the driver to get acquainted with the vehicle. (Even though we barely had the remaining time) **We also ran through the competition items to make sure everything was ready, and to let us know what to do when similar situations occur.**

Since the testing time for us was not long, we put our attention onto finding the problems and understanding the vehicle. (I also tried sitting behind the wheel, it was a cool, cool experience😎, and very satisfying too.🙌)

### The Challenges

- Looking for the testing site.
- Procedure when problems occur.
- Transportation to the competition site.

**At this time the problems usually showed up suddenly, we must learn to react quickly and address them accordingly.** What we could do was trying to lower the chance and building a procedure to handle similar problems.

Before getting into the competition, teams have to submit a video of the vehicle in operation (Shakedown Certificate). In a way to make sure teams are ready for the competition. If the teams couldn't pass Shakedown Certificate, they will only be able to join the static event of the competition. As for the vehicle transportation from Taiwan to Japan, we needed to make sure the packaing and documentation were fully prepared. These procedures seemed trivial but turned out to be lessons in the operational side.

## Compete

Before getting into the competition, the shipment from Taiwan to Japan took approximate 3 weeks, we focused on presentation and design documentation then (they were for static event).

### On-site

**For FS Japan 2019, there were 98 teams, with 27 electric vehicles participating and 4 teams from Taiwan.** The competition was 5 days long, 3 for the static event and 2 for dynamic event. As mentioned, the team has to pass the static inspection to compete in the dynamic event for safety concerns. And for electric class, teams have to pass both technical and electrical inspection to be qualified in dynamic. Other static events like design, cost, and business presentation were also held in the first 3 days.

/>

The vehicle examinations wasn’t that smooth for us but we took it one step at a time. The challenge was the competition wasn’t long, teams had to run through all the events quickly, especially examinations. The static event ended in the third day of the competition, which means after that teams won’t be able to join the dynamic event. After several times of checks and modifications, we were at the end of the examinations and time was ticking... Since the error in accumulator, we're stuck at the final check for the electrical system. Thus we couldn’t join the dynamic event in the last 2 days.😢 We still could finish the examinations in the following days, but without the ticket to join the dynamic.

/>

For the last 2 days, apart from enjoying the dynamic event🏎️, we also spent lots of time learning from the judges and other teams. It was brilliant to find so many passionate hearts and to share experiences and thoughts with one another. And we were so glad that some designs were recognized for a first-year electric team. The competition clearly showed us what could be achieved with the effort from both the industry and academic.

👉Note: For 27 EVs, 11 passed the inspection, 9 joined the dynamic event, 7 finished the race, we finished 13 out of 27. More information about the completion results can be found [here](https://www.jsae.or.jp/formula/en/docu/2019announcements.pdf).

## Lesson Learned

### Self-education

The knowledge and tool were mostly new (or unfamiliar) to us, thus learning by ourselves became basic skill we must have. It can be said that **learning is one of the core reasons this project exists.**

### Cross-division collaboration

It’s impossible to have these great achievements without teamwork, collaboration between members with different backgrounds is essential behind these results.

### Problems solving techniques

The whole journey in this project was full of problems, not only technical but also team operational and many more. This is the one I learned the most after the season ended💭.

## Next Step

This year easily became one of the best for me in university (and probably a year with least sleep😂), being able to build & learn things with a great team was really fantastic. So many things happened in this year, the highs and lows, the doubts and the confidence, they are all huge lessons for us.

The project should have a multi-year plan due to its scope and aspects. And we had marked a great start, but the more important mission is the sustainability. How might we continue and make improvements in the following seasons? What is the team trying to achieve through the project? Those are questions we have to answer later on.

To conclude (and again), this is a project about dicovery, teamwork, and passion. It's to discover the world, industry, team members, and myself, to work & play as a team, and to do those with passion. I'm very grateful to be part of it, and proud of what we have accomplished.🥂
