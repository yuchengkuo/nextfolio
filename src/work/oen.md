## All-in-one platform for businesses, nonprofits and campaigns

[Oen Tech](https://oen.tw) is a CRM-driven payment platform that brings engagement, fundraising, and membership together for nonprofits, businesses, and campaigns.

I joined the team in 2021 as the first and sole UI/UX designer. Over the time, I worked on several key new features and enhancements for the CRM platform. My contributions have included topics around payment management, e-commerce, CMS editor, events hosting and email marketing, among various tasks. Additionally, I contributed to multiple website projects that integrated with the Oen services for nonprofits, politician and campaigns as well.

The following are some selective of the projects that I have worked on:

## Event attendees check-in

This was one of the first major projects after joining the team. At that time, event organizers could already create events and open to registration on Oen. However, it was also critical for organizers to be able to efficiently check in participants because it allows them to track attendance, manage capacity, and ensure everyone who has registered or purchased a ticket is accounted for.

Collaborating with the team, we explored numerous ways to ensure the event check-in process was straight-forward and easy. We eventually developed a system that started from inviting team members inside admin panel and accepting check-in invitations, to therefore checking in guests either by scanning QR code or searching in the guest list. Additionally, It enabled event hosts to view basic stats on attendance rates for different type of tickets.

This update had proven to be very essential for ensuring a smooth and organized event experience. After the release of the feature, we added further support for registration form and promotion codes, which made the whole event hosting functionality more versatile. Ultimately, this resulted in a better overall event experience for both organizers and attendees.

## Payment statistic dashboard

For businesses and organizations, it's critical to be able to gain insights into key payment metrics on a payment platform in order to make data-driven decisions. The payment statistics dashboard pioneered to provide this information inside Oen to help make informed decisions about fundraising and engagement strategies.

To maximize the values, we conducted research and analyzed the most crucial metrics for the organizations. I also worked on making sure the fitting translations between numbers and graphs by utilizing different types of chart and understanding the power and limits of the chosen chart library. This had led to a valuable tool for organizations to identify problems and bring in optimization.

The final dashboard featured clear visualizations of important metrics such as payment methods, average payment amounts and payer demographics, and allowed businesses to look into transaction details and easily filter data by date, payment method, and other criteria. As a result, businesses had a much better understanding of their transaction data and were able to make more informed decisions about their strategies.

## New checkout experience

In the past, it was necessary for users to travel across domains to complete purchases because it enabled users to easily browse and shop merchandise from different organizations at the same place to manage orders and track status. However, several findings had stated that users mostly entered the organizations’ site to make the target purchases instead of browsing. The journey across domains not only increased the time and resistance to finish purchases for users, but lost the audience insights and metrics for the organizations too.

To address these issues, we worked on altering the checkout into a more intuitive process with smooth interaction by removing repetitive steps and providing useful information. I also applied the initiated pattern and component library to ensure the consistency and coherence. This had allowed users to make purchase in a more streamline and predictable way.

This update considerably reduce the effort to make purchases and allowed the organizations to gain deeper understanding of their audience. At the same time, it helped strengthen the organizations’ brand and bring up uniformity, which set the vital foundation for future growth and extension.

Several additional features were also implemented after the initial release: promotion codes, member-only products, subscription, and bidding. These empower organizations to even better engage with their audience in their chosen approach.

## Other websites projects

Outside the main product itself, I also contributed to several customized website integrated with services provided by Oen. This enables organizations or nonprofits who lack technical resources to manage their website through a single platform supercharged by Oen services, which enable accepting donation, issuing receipts, hosting events and more.

### New Homepage development

In addition to external website projects, I also collaborated with a contract designer to develop the new homepage as well, bringing in modernity with vibrant illustrations and calm colors.
