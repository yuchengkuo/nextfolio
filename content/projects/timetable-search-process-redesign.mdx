## Overview

This is a self-initiated project with an purpose to practice experience and interface design skills. The idea came from personal struggle with the current product. And the goal was to come up with a more intuitive and simplified process for timetable searching.

## Discovery

### Background

[Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA)](https://www.railway.gov.tw/tra-tip-web/tip?lang=EN_US) manages and maintains the railway service in Taiwan. Recently released (2019) fourth generation of the ticket booking system offers services like ticket booking, timetable searching, and live train info. Thereâ€™re other third party apps that provide similar services, but ticket booking is exclusive to the official TRA platform.

The project covers the redesign of the mainly used service, search process for train timetable.

### The Problem

From various secondary researches, one of the problems in the current searching process is it's tedious and time-consuming. Especially when the user need to switch between the departure and arrival stations often, or switch between different types of results. **Users will need to take multiple similar actions to obtain the search results.**

ðŸ‘‰Note: From the user feedback on the [app store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1441617748) and [google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tw.gov.tra.twtraffic), the payment process also have some problems, as well as other miscellaneous improvements.

### The Challenge

- Large amount of the stations and counties: 242 stations and 19 counties.
- 3 different result types: timetable, station, and train.
- 7 sublines apart from the mainline.

### Current Analysis

For official TRA-E booking app, I throughly analyzed the current product and service flow, hoping to discover the opportunities to improve the overall experience.

ðŸ‘‰Note: Other third-party apps also share similar search process, thus the analysis was on official one.

  alt="Current timetable app analysis."

  height={760}
/>

With these analyses, some key findings are,

1. Touch areas are relatively small.
2. Some labels don't provide enough information about what the functioalities are and what they will do.
3. Low contrast ratio for some elements on the interface.
4. Spacings between elements are inconsistent.
5. The usage of long list increase the difficulty to find and set the stations.

### Map Out Current User Flow

The current user flow breaks the process into 4 different process but similar elements appears in each one, common actions are like selecting stations, set date & time, train type, etc.

## Define

### Ideation

With the problems and analysis, I sketch out some ideas to visulaize possible solutions. **Avoiding the usage of long list is my top consideration.** Since reducing searching time is the ultimate goal.

### Refined User Flow

The redesigned user flow combines common actions and empasize the hierachy, key changes are,

1. Simplify the overall search process
2. Seperate the required information from searching information and booking ticket
3. Prioritize the timetable searching from the other two types of results

### Detailed User Flow

The detailed user flow shows the searching process before ticket booking. The main user flow is assumed to be searching for timetable, and without manually inputting the stations or trains. Users can select from recent search history, pick from saved library or use the search popup window to obtain the results.

## Design

With how it will work in mind and after some explorations, I find this version the most clear and simple.

## Develop

### Mid-fidelity Interactive Prototype

I created a interactive prototype to demonstrate the redesigned search process flow and some of the interactions.

## Outcome

Even though the searching time mainly depends on the users, the redesigned search process still offers a more intuitive and simplified way to obtain timetable information.

### Reflection

The project taught me the design process and what should be considered at each phase. And here are some things that I might do differently,

1. Use icons alongside with the colors in the train types for better indication.
2. Establish a clear idenfication for main stations.
3. Further consideration of the swipe action usage.

### Next Step

Some further implementations could be made,

1. Hi-fi prototype to properly show the interactions.
2. Plug in the real stations data.
