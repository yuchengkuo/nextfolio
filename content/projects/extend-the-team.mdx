## Overview

As new technology evolves much more quickly, the rapid advancement of the industry makes it harder for undergrad students to keep up. Therefore, we were hoping through this project we can closer the gap and also discover new possibilities.

This project started during my junior year at NCKU, with less than 10 members to begin (30 when the season ended). **The primary goal was to build a formula-style racecar to compete in Formula Student (FS) event.** As one of the kick-off members, I had the opportunity to execute and learn end to end. It was a wild ride and a special experience for me.ü§òüèº

## Formula Student

Formula Student (or [Formula SAE](https://www.fsaeonline.com/) in some countries) is one of the biggest student events around the world, **whose purpose is giving undergrad students an opportunity for practical application skills**.

The teams shall think themselves as small-scale vehicle manufacturers to design, develop and produce a formula-style racecar, working on various aspects like operating, designing, manufacturing and marketing. **As for now, more than 20 events and 200 teams are active around the world**.

There are two events in the competition, static event and dynamic event. Static event is about rule-compliance, safety, strategy, and business presentation, dynamic is about the performance on the track. **Teams have to pass the static technical inspection to join the dynamic event.**

> We participated in [Formula Student Japan 2019](https://www.jsae.or.jp/formula/en/17th/eventoutline.php), which was held at late Aug.

**There are three main classes in the competition, combustion, electric and autonomous.** Combustion started in the 1980s, which has the longest history and most resources, therefore it‚Äôs easiest to begin and has the largest amount of teams. Electric was introduced in the 2010s, with the increase of difficulty, resources-taken, and the issue of safety, while the project aspects are wider than combustion gasoline. Autonomous started in 2019, which is the most advanced, now teams and competitions are mostly in Europe and the US.

> We aimed for electric class for broader diversity and promising trend of EV.‚ö°Ô∏è
