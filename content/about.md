My name is YuCheng Kuo. I am a self-taught design engineer from Taiwan. Currently working as a UI/UX designer at [Oen Tech](https://oen.tw), helping building the software that brings engagement, fundraising, and payment together for nonprofits, campaigns and all kinds of orgs.

I am always fascinated by the connection between how technologies reshape our daily lives and how we then reshape new technologies in the future.

I value multi-disciplined skills that could help people achieve their goals in a delightful and simple way. And I seek ambitious teams where together, we can create lasting and impactful experience that fulfill both user needs and business goals.

## Me

I first got into digital design and web tech with the attempt to make school presentations more enjoyable for the audience. Due to the findings that most of the presentations are made in a relatively one-directional way, I attempted to raise the engagement by:

- _making it eye-catching_ (learning more about layout, typography without knowing what them were)
- _bringing in meaningful animations_ (discovring motion graphics through this)
- _finding the right tool to present_ (researching about the presenting tools, landed on [Prezi](https://prezi.com) and [Pitch](https://pitch.com), which later introduced me into the www world).

After those, with the lead of passionate curiosity and constant learning, I had accquired strong love of both desiging feasible solutions and developing with good design.

Outside of history, I'm an avid music listener, broadly listening to indie, r&b, alternative and some electronic. Often intended to feel when listening to music. Also a lil tv/film enthusiast.
