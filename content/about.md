{% column n=2 %}

My name is YuCheng Kuo. I am a product designer and UI developer from Taiwan. Currently working as a designer/engineer at [Oen Tech](https://oen.tw), helping building the software that brings engagement, fundraising, and payment together for Nonprofits, campaigns and all kinds of orgs.

I am always fascinated by the connection between how technologies reshape our daily lives and how we then reshape new technologies in the future.

I value multi-disciplined skills that could help people achieve their goals in a delightful and simple way. And I seek ambitious teams where together, we can create lasting and impactful experience that fulfill both user needs and business goals.

## More about me

I first got into digital design/front-end with the attempt to make school presentations enjoyable for the audience (sounds actually weird). With the lead of passionate curiosity and constant self-learning, I had accquired strong love of both desiging feasible solutions and developing with good design.

Aside from above, I'm an avid music listener and tv/film enthusiast. My favorite and best experience is feeling the music and living the scenes. Working on [listening](/listening) and [watching](/watching) page to showcase some of the current loves.
